The code is a Streamlit dashboard for recording the participants in a lab study. It allows the user to select a study name from a dropdown list, enter the start and end time of the study, and the number of participants. For each participant, the code prompts the user to enter the session number, name, age, and gender. The data is stored in a list and written to a CSV file when the user presses the "Submit" button. The code uses the streamlit library to create the UI, and the csv library to write the data to the file. The datetime library is used to get the current date.

The code consists of a main function that contains the UI elements and logic for recording the data. It uses text input fields, a select box, time inputs, and a button to allow the user to enter the required information. The data is written to the CSV file using the csv library, which opens the file in append mode to add the new data to any existing data in the file. The code also uses the strftime method from the datetime library to format the date as a string in the desired format.
